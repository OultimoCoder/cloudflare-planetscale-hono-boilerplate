# RESTful API Cloudflare Workers Boilerplate
A boilerplate/starter project for quickly building RESTful APIs using
[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), [Hono](https://honojs.dev/), and
[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/). Inspired by
[node-express-boilerplate](https://github.com/hagopj13/node-express-boilerplate) by hagopj13.

## Quick Start

To create a project, simply run:

```bash
npx create-cf-planetscale-app <project-name>
```

Or

```bash
npm init cf-planetscale-app <project-name>
```

## Features

- **SQL database**: [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) using
[Kysely](https://github.com/koskimas/kysely) as a type-safe SQl query builder
- **Authentication and authorization**: using JWT
- **Validation**: request data validation using [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
- **Logging**: using [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
- **Testing**: unit and integration tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
- **Error handling**: centralised error handling mechanism provided by [Hono](https://honojs.dev/)
- **Git hooks**: with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- **Linting**: with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- **Emails**: with [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/)
- **Oauth**: Support for Discord, Github, Spotify, Google and Facebook. Support coming for Apple and
  Twitter.

## Commands

Running locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Testing:

```bash
# run all tests
npm run tests

# run test coverage
npm run tests:coverage

# run test coverage summary
npm run tests:summary
```

Linting:

```bash
# run ESLint
npm run lint

# fix ESLint errors
npm run lint:fix

# run prettier
npm run prettier

# fix prettier errors
npm run prettier:fix
```

Migrations:

To deploy to production you must first deploy to a test/dev branch on Planetscale and then create
a deploy request and merge the schema into production.

```bash
# run all migrations for dev/test
npm run migrate:dev:latest
npm run migrate:test:latest

# remove all migrations for dev/test
npm run migrate:dev:none
npm run migrate:test:none

# revert last migration for dev/test
npm run migrate:dev:down
npm run migrate:test:down
```

Deploy to Cloudflare:

```bash
npm run deploy:dev
npm run deploy:prod
```

## Error Handling

The app has a centralized error handling mechanism provided by [Hono](https://honojs.dev/).

```javascript
app.onError(errorHandler)
```

All errors will be caught by the errorHandler which converts the error to an ApiError and formats
it in a JSON response. Any errors that aren't intentionally thrown, e.g. 500 errors, are logged to
Sentry.

The error handling middleware sends an error response, which has the following format:

```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Not found"
}
```

When running in development mode, the error response also contains the error stack.

## Validation

Request data is validated using [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

The validation schemas are defined in the `src/validations` directory and are used in the
controllers by getting either the query or body and then calling the parse on the relevant
validation function:


```javascript
const getUsers: Handler<{ Bindings: Bindings }> = async (c) => {
  const config = getConfig(c.env)
  const queryParse = c.req.query()
  const query = userValidation.getUsers.parse(queryParse)
  const filter = { email: query.email }
  const options = { sortBy: query.sort_by, limit: query.limit, page: query.page }
  const result = await userService.queryUsers(filter, options, config.database)
  return c.json(result, httpStatus.OK as StatusCode)
}
```

## Authentication

To require authentication for certain routes, you can use the `auth` middleware.

```javascript
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import * as userController from '../controllers/user.controller'
import { auth } from '../middlewares/auth'

const route = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>()

route.post('/', auth(), userController.createUser)

export { route }

```

These routes require a valid JWT access token in the Authorization request header using the Bearer
schema. If the request does not contain a valid access token, an Unauthorized (401) error is thrown.

## Emails

Support for Email sending using [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/). Just call the `sendEmail`
function in `src/services/email.service.ts`:

```javascript
const sendResetPasswordEmail = async (email: string, emailData: EmailData, config: Config) => {
  const message = {
    Subject: {
      Data: 'Reset your password',
      Charset: 'UTF-8'
    },
    Body: {
      Text: {
        Charset: 'UTF-8',
        Data: `
          Hello ${emailData.name}
          Please reset your password by clicking the following link:
          ${emailData.token}
        `
      }
    }
  }
  await sendEmail(email, config.email.sender, message, config.aws)
}
```

## Authorisation

The `auth` middleware can also be used to require certain rights/permissions to access a route.

```javascript
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import * as userController from '../controllers/user.controller'
import { auth } from '../middlewares/auth'

const route = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>()

route.post('/', auth('manageUsers'), userController.createUser)

export { route }
```

In the example above, an authenticated user can access this route only if that user has the
`manageUsers` permission.

The permissions are role-based. You can view the permissions/rights of each role in the
`src/config/roles.ts` file.

If the user making the request does not have the required permissions to access this route, a
Forbidden (403) error is thrown.

## Rate Limiting

To apply rate limits for certain routes, you can use the `rateLimit` middleware.

```javascript
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { Environment } from '../../bindings'
import { auth } from '../middlewares/auth'
import { rateLimit } from '../middlewares/rateLimiter'

export const route = new Hono<Environment>()

const twoMinutes = 120
const oneRequest = 1

route.post(
  '/send-verification-email',
  auth(),
  rateLimit(twoMinutes, oneRequest),
  authController.sendVerificationEmail
)
```

This uses Cloudflare durable objects to apply rate limits using the sliding window algorithm. You
can specify the interval size in seconds and how many requests are allowed per interval.

If the rate limit is hit a `429` will be returned to the client.

These headers are returned with each endpoint that has rate limiting applied:

* `X-RateLimit-Limit` - How many requests are allowed per window
* `X-RateLimit-Reset` - How many seconds until the current window resets
* `X-RateLimit-Policy` - Details about the rate limit policy in this format `${limit};w=${interval};comment="Sliding window"`
* `X-RateLimit-Remaining` - How many requests you can send until you will be rate limited. Please
note this doesn't just reset to the limit when the reset period hits. Use it as indicator of your
current throughput e.g. if you have 12 requests allowed every 1 second and remaining is 0
you are at 100% throughput, but if it is 6 you are 50% throughput. This value constantly changes
as the window progresses either increasing or decreasing based on your throughput
